/**
 * @title DrugSupplyChain
 *
 * @dev This contract manages the drug supply chain, allowing manufacturers, distributors, and retailers to
 * create batches, handle returns, and manage roles.
 * It uses Chainlink for price feeds and automation for handling return requests.
 * It implements role-based access control using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl.
 * The contract allows for batch creation, purchase by distributors and retailers, return requests,
 * and approval of return requests.
 * It also includes functionality for reselling batches and managing addresses.
 * The contract emits events for significant actions such as batch creation, purchases, return requests,
 * and role management.
 * It ensures that only authorized roles can perform specific actions, and it provides mechanisms
 * to freeze and unfreeze addresses to prevent unauthorized actions.
 * The contract is designed to be secure, with checks for valid addresses, batch ownership, and
 * appropriate status checks before allowing actions like reselling or returning batches.
 * The contract is designed to ensure the integrity and authenticity of drugs in the supply chain.
 *
 * @author Kisna Gupta
 *
 * @notice This contract is part of a larger drug supply chain system and should be used in conjunction with other contracts
 * in the system for full functionality.
